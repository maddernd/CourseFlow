We may align ourselves with different religions and politics. Online we encounter and identify with further diversity. We all learn in many different ways, and through multiple pedagogical interactions. Using the arts and popular culture, as well as critical theory, research and policy, the unit thinks about how these diversities might affect participation in both formal and informal educational spaces. The unit proposes that design principles for learning (linked to students&rsquo; interests) can respect and welcome in diversity, enable empathy and create belonging. Above all, the unit aims to increase students&rsquo; capacity to make a social justice impact through developing engaging and inclusive resources in their planned professional practice. Whether students are aspiring to work in, for example, advertising, media, creative arts, museums and galleries, administration or education, or any other field, this unit will support the development of cultural insights.

Due to the inherently probabilistic nature of AI Solutions, practitioners need new tools and approaches to assist them in building robust solutions. In this unit you will learn how to manage challenges that arise when building AI Solutions and gain a deep understanding of how to overcome these challenges. Throughout the course you will learn how to plan for and design the core elements of an AI Solution and guided through the development from concept all the way through to a deployable artefact.

In this unit students will explore, research and implement solutions to a range of RL problems or Markov Decision Process (MDP), including variants such as: discrete-time MDP; Semi-MDPs (SMDP); continuous-time MDPs; Partially Observable-MDP (POMDP) and Multi-objective MDPs (MOMDP). In solving these problems, students will apply their knowledge and skills with a range of techniques such as: multi-armed bandits; reward design; value iteration; policy gradient; temporal difference learning; on-policy; off-policy; eligibility traces; feature construction; and, continuous action. Additionally, students will research and discuss topics such as; curriculum; interactive; inverse; transfer; ensemble; hierarchical; curiosity, multi-goal; multi-agent; multi-objective and deep RL.",
